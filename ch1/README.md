# Chapter 1 Notes
	
## experiments
	An experiment is a way to prove/disprove your hypothesis in a controlled environment.

## Experiment vs Observational study:
	- Observational study is trying to observe things that are already occuring, while an experiment is trying to observe how a system reacts to changes that are artificially introduced.

## Association:
	- When variables have a link / are related

## causation:
	- One of the variables caues another
	- Causation can only be concluded from a randomized experiment	
	- Association does not necessarilly imply causation

Independent:
	- Non-associated variables
