## Experiments
- An experiment is a way to prove/disprove your hypothesis in a controlled environment.

### Experiment
- An experiment entails observing how a system reacts to changes that are artificially introduced.
### Observational study:
- Observational study is trying to observe things that are already occuring.
- This is usually done rather than an experiment for ethical reasons.

### Association:
- When variables have a link / are related.

### causation:
- One of the variables caues another
- Causation can only be concluded from a randomized experiment	
- Association does not necessarilly imply causation

### Independent:
- Non-associated variables

### Different Methods
- Simple random sampling
	- Each case has an equal chance of being included
- Stratified sampling
	- divide and conquer sampling strategy
- Cluster sampling
	- break population into small groups called "clusters"
	- clusters are usually not made up from homoheneous observations.
- Multistage sampling
