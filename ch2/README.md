## Numerical Data

### Scatterplot
- A scatterplot provides a case-by-case view of data for two numerical variables x and y.
- x is the explanatory/independent variable	
- y is the response/dependent variable 
- x -> f(x) -> y
- Scatterplots have different strengths of relationship.
	-	Generally, the more grouped together the points, the stronger the relationship

### Dotplot
- A dotplot FINISH THIS
- A parameter summarizes data from a population into a single number.
- A statistic summarizes the data from a sample into a single number.


- Mean: The average of the data
	- Sample mean:
		- Can be denoted with x̄
	- Population mean
		- Denoted with µ
- Median: The center value
- Mode: The most common data point
