## Numerical Data

Scatterplot:
- A scatterplot provides a case-by-case view of data for two numerical variables x and y.
- x is the explanatory/independent variable	
- y is the response/dependent variable 
- x -> f(x) -> y
- Scatterplots have different strengths of relationship.
	-	Generally, the more grouped together the points, the stronger the relationship
