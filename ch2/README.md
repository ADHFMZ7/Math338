# Chapter 2 Notes - Visualizing Data

## Numerical Data

- Mean: The average of the data distribution 
	- Sample mean:
		- This is the mean of sample from the population
		- Can be denoted with x̄
	- Population mean
		- This is the man of the entire population
		- Denoted with µ
- Median: The center value
- Mode: The most common data point


### Scatterplot
- A scatterplot provides a case-by-case view of data for two numerical variables x and y
- x is the explanatory/independent variable	
- y is the response/dependent variable 
- x -> f(x) -> y
- Scatterplots have different strengths of relationship
	-	Generally, the more grouped together the points, the stronger the relationship

### Dotplot
- A dotplot is a one-variable scatterplot
- A parameter summarizes data from a population into a single number
- A statistic summarizes the data from a sample into a single number


### Distributions
- TAKE GOOD NOTES ON THIS AT HOME
- Normal Distribution
- Bell curve


## Categorical Data

Categorical data is data that falls into discrete categories rather than numbers.

There are many ways we can visualize categorical data, each with their own beneifts.

### Contingency tables
- A table that summarizes data for two categorical variables.
- Each cell shows the number of observational units that are in the row and column variables.

### Bar Plot
- Used to visualize one categorical variable.
- A bar plot is one way to visualize categorical data.
- It shows association based on the sizes of the bars.

### Stacked Bar Plot
- This variation of a Bar Plot can be used to plot two categorical variables.
- It stacks two bars on top of eachother.
- There is also a standardized bar plot that compares proportions rather than frequency.

### Mosaic Plots

### Pie Charts
