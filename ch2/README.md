# Chapter 2 Notes

## Numerical Data

- Mean: The average of the data distribution 
	- Sample mean:
		- This is the mean of sample from the population
		- Can be denoted with x̄
	- Population mean
		- This is the man of the entire population
		- Denoted with µ
- Median: The center value
- Mode: The most common data point


### Scatterplot
- A scatterplot provides a case-by-case view of data for two numerical variables x and y
- x is the explanatory/independent variable	
- y is the response/dependent variable 
- x -> f(x) -> y
- Scatterplots have different strengths of relationship
	-	Generally, the more grouped together the points, the stronger the relationship

### Dotplot
- A dotplot is a one-variable scatterplot
- A parameter summarizes data from a population into a single number
- A statistic summarizes the data from a sample into a single number


### Distributions
- TAKE GOOD NOTES ON THIS AT HOME
- Normal Distribution
- Bell curve

## Categorical Data

Categorical data is data that falls into discrete categories rather than numbers.

### Bar Plot
- A bar plot is one way to visualize categorical data.
- It shows association based on the sizes of the bars.
