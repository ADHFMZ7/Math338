# Chapter 3 - Probability

probability is the proportion of times some desired event happens over an infinite amount of trials.

## Basic Probability

### quick definitions:
- Experiment: a repeatable procedure with well-defined possible outcomes.
- Sample space: The set of possible outcomes. denoted by 
- Event: A subset of the sample space. denoted by Ω


### Law of Large Numbers
 - If some event has probability n, as m, the amount of trials, approaches infinity, probability will converge to n.

### Sample Space

- The sample space is the set of all possible outcome.
- It is often denoted by Ω.

### Events

- An event is a subset of the sample space.
- It is usually the desired result of probability.

#### Disjoint events
- Disjoint events are events that cannot happen at the same time.
- They can be added together using the Addition Rule.
	- P(A OR B) = P(A) + A(B)

#### Overlapping Events
- Events that can both happen at the same time.
- These events can be added using the General Adition Rule
	- P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)
	- We subtract the last term to prevent double counting the union.

#### Event Complement
- The complement of an event is the set that contains everything that is not in the event set.
- It is also a subset of the sample space.
- It is often denoted as Ā, where A is any event.

#### Independent events
- Two events are independent if one occuring does not effect the probability of the other occuring.
- A good example of this is a coinflip. Flipping heads does not mean the next flip is more likely to be tails.
- Multiplication rule
	- P(A AND B) = P(A) * P(B)


## Conditional Probability

Conditional Probability is 

TAKE FIRST NOTES

- P(A | B) - read as probability of A given B happens.

- P(A | B) != P(B | A)

- This can be calculated with the following: P(A | B) = P(A and B) / P(B)
