# Chapter 3 - Probability

probability is the proportion of times some desired event happens over an infinite amount of trials.

## definitions:
- Experiment: a repeatable procedure with well-defined possible outcomes.
- Sample space: The set of possible outcomes. denoted by Ω
- Event: A subset of the sample space. denoted by 


## Law of Large Numbers
 - If some event has probability n, as m, the amount of trials, approaches infinity, probability will converge to n.

## Sample Space

The sample space of 

## Events

An event is a subset of the sample space.

### Disjoint events
- Disjoint events are events that cannot happen at the same time.
- They can be added together using the Addition Rule.
	- P(A OR B) = P(A) + A(B)

### Overlapping Events
- Events that can both happen at the same time.
- These events can be added using the General Adition Rule
	- P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)
	- We subtract the last term to prevent double counting the union.

Ex) 6 + 5 - 1 = 10/15
