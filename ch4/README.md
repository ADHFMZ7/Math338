# Chapter 4 - Probability Distributions

## Random Variables

## Normal Distribution 

## Geometric Distribution

### Bernoulli Distribution
- A Bernoulli trial is an experiment with exactly two outcomes.
- These outcomes are often labeled success and failure.
- A common example is a coinflip

## Binomial Distribution

- The binomial distribution describes the number of successes in a fixed number of trials.

- (n CHOOSE k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k) TODO: put this in LaTex
- mean: n * p
- standard deviation: sqrt(n * p * (1-p))
