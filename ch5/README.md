## Chapter 5 - Foundations for Inference

A population is a group of all ovservational units

A parameter summarizes the data from a population into a single number.

A sample is a subset of the population
Statistic summarizes data from a sample into a single number

p - the proportion of succeses in the population; parameter of interest
p̂ - the proportion of succeses in a sample of the population

we use p̂ to estimate p

## Error
When a difference is spotted between p and p-hat, it is called error. There are
2 different kinds;
- sampling error
	Describes how much an estimate will tend to vary from one sample to the next
- bias
	Describes systematic tendency to over or under-estimate the true population value

ssd = sample standard deviation = sigma

Standard error of p-hat is the following
SE = sqrt(p(1-p)/n)


## 5.2 stuff

Confidence intervals give an interval of values that p is 95% likely to be in (the 95 depends on the confidence level of the interval)
They are calculated by getting the critical-z value that corresponds with the percentage and multiplying it by the standard error 
Confidence interval = pe +- ME
ME = z* x 


## 5.3 stuff

Hypothesis testing

Hypothesis testing is used to see if a hypothesis could be true or not
it is done by making a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis
